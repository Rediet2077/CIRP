# Community Infrastructure Reporting Platform (CIRP)

> **A smart web and mobile platform for reporting, managing, analyzing, and resolving community infrastructure problems.**

---

# 1. Introduction

The **Community Infrastructure Reporting Platform (CIRP)** is a smart web and mobile-based system designed to improve how citizens report public infrastructure problems and how municipalities manage and resolve them.

Citizens can use the **Flutter mobile application** to report infrastructure problems such as road damage, water leakage, drainage problems, garbage, streetlight failures, and public facility damage. A report can include a description, photograph, category, and GPS location.

Municipality officers, contractors, and administrators use a **React-based web application** to review, verify, assign, monitor, and resolve infrastructure reports.

CIRP integrates **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** to make infrastructure management more intelligent, efficient, and data-driven.

The system includes four major smart capabilities:

* **AI Duplicate Report Detection**
* **AI Image-Based Infrastructure Classification**
* **GIS Maps and Heat Maps**
* **Multilingual Support: English, Amharic, Afaan Oromo, and Tigrinya**

# 2. Statement of the Problem

Public infrastructure problems such as potholes, damaged roads, water leakage, blocked drainage systems, garbage accumulation, and broken streetlights directly affect community safety and quality of life.

Traditional infrastructure reporting methods often depend on:

* Physical visits to municipal offices
* Telephone calls
* Paper-based complaints
* Unstructured social media reports
* Manual record keeping

These approaches create several problems:

1. **Slow reporting and response**
2. **Lack of report tracking**
3. **Duplicate complaints**
4. **Poor communication between citizens and authorities**
5. **Difficulty identifying the correct infrastructure category**
6. **Limited geographic analysis**
7. **Language barriers**
8. **Difficulty prioritizing infrastructure problems**
9. **Limited data for decision-making**
10. **Lack of transparency in the maintenance process**

CIRP addresses these problems by providing a centralized digital platform that connects citizens, municipality officers, contractors, and administrators.

# 3. Objectives

## 3.1 General Objective

To develop a smart web and mobile platform that enables citizens to report infrastructure problems and enables municipalities to efficiently verify, assign, monitor, analyze, and resolve those problems.

## 3.2 Specific Objectives

CIRP aims to:

* Provide an easy-to-use mobile reporting system.
* Allow citizens to submit images and GPS locations.
* Track infrastructure reports from submission to resolution.
* Automatically classify infrastructure problems using AI.
* Detect potentially duplicate reports using AI.
* Help officers make better decisions using AI-generated recommendations.
* Display infrastructure problems using interactive GIS maps.
* Generate GIS heat maps to identify problem hotspots.
* Support English, Amharic, Afaan Oromo, and Tigrinya.
* Improve communication between citizens and municipalities.
* Improve maintenance task assignment and monitoring.
* Provide dashboards and analytics for decision-making.
* Improve transparency and accountability.
* Reduce duplicate reports and unnecessary resource usage.

# 4. Key Features

## 4.1 Citizen Mobile Application

Citizens can:

* Register and log in.
* Select their preferred language.
* Report infrastructure problems.
* Take photos using the camera.
* Upload images from the gallery.
* Capture their current GPS location.
* Select a location from the map.
* Select or confirm an infrastructure category.
* View submitted reports.
* Track report status.
* Receive notifications.
* Manage their profile.

---

## 4.2 AI Duplicate Detection

CIRP uses AI to identify reports that may describe the same infrastructure problem.

The system can compare:

* Report descriptions
* Images
* Geographic locations
* Categories

### Example

```text
Report A:
"Large pothole near DBU gate."

Report B:
"Big road hole close to the university entrance."
```

The system can identify these reports as potentially related.

Example result:

```json
{
  "is_duplicate": true,
  "similarity_score": 0.92,
  "similar_report_id": 1024
}
```

The final decision to merge reports remains with the municipality officer.

---

## 4.3 AI Image Classification

When a citizen uploads an infrastructure image, the AI model analyzes it and suggests a category.

Possible categories include:

* Road Damage
* Water Leakage
* Garbage
* Drainage
* Streetlight
* Public Facility
* Other

### Example

```text
Uploaded Image
      ↓
AI Model
      ↓
Road Damage
      ↓
94% Confidence
```

The prediction is a recommendation and can be corrected by the citizen or municipality officer.

---

## 4.4 GIS Maps

CIRP uses GIS to display infrastructure reports geographically.

Municipality officers can:

* View report locations.
* Search locations.
* Filter reports.
* View individual reports on a map.
* Analyze problem distribution.

---



Heat maps help municipalities identify infrastructure problem hotspots and prioritize resources.

```

## 7.6 Transparent Citizen Tracking

Citizens can see what happens after submitting a report instead of simply submitting a complaint and waiting for a response.

## 7.7 Data-Driven Municipal Decision Making

GIS and analytics allow municipality authorities to identify:

* Problem hotspots
* Frequent infrastructure categories
* Response times
* Resolution rates
* Maintenance trends

---

# 8. Security

CIRP will implement:

* JWT authentication
* Password hashing
* Role-based access control

# 13. Conclusion

The **Community Infrastructure Reporting Platform (CIRP)** provides a centralized and intelligent solution for managing community infrastructure problems.

The platform connects citizens, municipality officers, contractors, and administrators through mobile and web applications.

The combination of **Flutter, React, Django, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, AI, and GIS technologies** provides a scalable foundation for digital infrastructure management.

The four major innovations of CIRP are:

> **AI Duplicate Detection**
> **AI Image Classification**
> **GIS Heat Maps**
> **English, Amharic, Afaan Oromo & Tigrinya Support**

Through these capabilities, CIRP can reduce duplicate reports, simplify infrastructure classification, identify geographic problem hotspots, improve communication, and provide municipalities with better information for decision-making.

The ultimate goal of CIRP is to create a more **transparent, accessible, intelligent, and efficient infrastructure reporting and management process** that connects community members with the authorities responsible for maintaining their public environment.
